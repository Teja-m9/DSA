# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains my daily practice on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. I am committed to solving various problems related to DSA topics and pushing my progress every day to track my learning.

### üõ†Ô∏è Repository Contents:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, etc.
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and other competitive programming sites.

### üìÖ Daily Practice:
- I am solving problems on a daily basis and pushing my solutions to this repository.
- The repository will continuously grow, with each folder organized by the DSA topic or specific problem.
  
### üìÇ Repository Structure:
Each folder will contain:
- **Problems**: A brief description or problem statement.
- **Solutions**: My code implementation for that specific problem.
- **Notes**: Any notes, explanations, or thought processes related to the problem-solving approach.

### üîß Technologies and Languages Used:
- **Languages**: Java (Primary), Python (for some problems)
- **Tools**: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA (for coding), Git (for version control)
